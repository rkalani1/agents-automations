# User requirements traceability

> **Pass:** v0.5 (subscription-first expansion, deepening pass) · **Last updated:** 2026-05-06

This document maps each user requirement and each acceptance criterion from the v0.4 + v0.5 task briefs to the implementation files that satisfy it, and the status. Status values: `complete`, `partial`, `blocked`.

The site-rendered version of this file lives at [`docs/product-requirements/user-requirements-traceability.md`](docs/product-requirements/user-requirements-traceability.md) and is kept in sync.
