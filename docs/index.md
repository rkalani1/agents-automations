# Describe the task. Get the right AI workflow.

**No API key required. Start with the AI app you already use.**

This site is free, runs in your browser, and works on whatever AI subscription you already pay for — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, GitHub Copilot, or even "I don't know what I'm using."

Describe a task. Pick the app you already have. Get a complete, copy-pasteable workflow plus a **level-up ladder** that shows you the next useful capability — saved prompts, projects, memory, custom assistants, skills, scheduled tasks, and (only if you want) developer tools.

No command line, no install, no signup beyond the AI app you already use.

!!! warning "Public data boundary"

    Examples, evals, and starter kits use synthetic placeholders only. Do not paste PHI, patient data, employee records, student records, credentials, confidential business data, or restricted institutional material into public demos, prompts, issue reports, or repository fixtures.

## Pick the right starting point

You do not need to read this site front to back. Start with the row that matches you.

| If you are... | Do this first | You should have by the end |
|---|---|---|
| An absolute beginner | [Open the Task Builder](task-builder/index.md), leave **Beginner Mode** on, and describe one real task. | A prompt to paste, exact clicks, and a safe fallback using the AI app you already have. |
| Learning Claude specifically | [Open the standalone Claude site](https://claude.ai/) and follow Day 0 before exploring advanced features. | Account instructions, one Project, a reusable prompt kit, and a safe path to Skills, connectors, and Claude Code. |
| Trying to get more value from one subscription | Run the [7-mission learning path](learning-path/index.md). | A portable AI profile, reusable prompt, Project/Gem/Space, citation habit, and evaluation routine. |
| Choosing between ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, or Copilot | Use the [Capability map](capability-map/index.md) and [Mastery hub](mastery/index.md). | A deliberate tool choice for each recurring workflow instead of defaulting to whichever tab is open. |
| Building a real agent or coding workflow | Start with [Agent Factory](agent-factory/index.md), [Evals & safety](evals/index.md), and [Starter kits](starter-kits.md). | A scoped agent spec, tool allowlist, eval set, red-team probes, and launch checklist. |
| Responsible for a team or sensitive data | Read [Team path](start-here/team-path.md), [Safety baseline](start-here/safety-baseline.md), and [Human-in-the-loop](safety/hitl.md). | A permission model, review gates, data boundaries, and off-switch before any automation runs. |

## Three example outputs from the Task Builder

These are real shapes the Task Builder produces. Click any to jump to a worked example.

### Weekly research summary

> **Input:** "Every Monday I want a one-page summary of the past week's newly-deposited preprints in my field, with three highlighted papers and questions for journal club. I have ChatGPT and Claude. Inputs come from a folder of PDFs I save during the week. Output goes to my Obsidian vault. Manual run only."

The Task Builder routes this to a **Project** (ChatGPT or Claude) plus a **prompt** plus a **manual playbook** — not an agent, not a scheduler.

It produces: a system prompt, a Project description, a memory/preferences block ("MIND-diet research, NEJM citation style, no full-text reproduction"), an output schema, a 5-case eval set, three red-team probes (e.g., "what if a PDF is image-only?"), and a Monday playbook with the exact 60-second steps.

[→ See this output as a worked recipe: Literature triage](recipes/literature-triage.md)

### Repository maintenance

> **Input:** "Keep `my-org/my-repo` healthy: dependency updates, lint fixes, and tiny refactors that pass CI. I have Claude Code and GitHub Copilot. Anything that opens a PR has to be reviewed by a human."

The Task Builder routes this to a **coding agent** workflow (Claude Code locally for the dev loop, GitHub Copilot cloud agent for hands-off PRs), with a **CLAUDE.md** / **AGENTS.md** scaffold, an **HITL gate** that forbids `git push` to `main`, an eval set ("PR diff is small," "tests pass," "no new dependencies without review"), and a maintenance cadence.

[→ See this output as a worked recipe: Repo maintenance](recipes/repo-maintenance.md)

### Email and calendar triage

> **Input:** "First-thing-in-the-morning brief: triage overnight email into Now/Later/Reference/Trash, and write a one-paragraph prep note for each meeting today. Connectors: Gmail and Calendar via ChatGPT. Drafts only, never send."

The Task Builder routes this to a **Project + connectors** (read-only) plus a **draft-only refusal block** so the agent never sends a reply on your behalf. It produces a system prompt, a connector permission spec, an eval set with at least one ambiguous "is this Now or Later?" case, and three red-team probes (prompt injection from email body, calendar invite spoofing, forward-this-to-X attempts).

## Boundaries this guide enforces

- **No real secrets in any example.** All API keys, tokens, and personal info are placeholders.
- **No background automations or schedulers run by default.** Every cron / launchd / Task Scheduler example is opt-in and marked as such ([ADR 0003](decision-records/0003-no-default-schedulers.md)).
- **No tracking, analytics, or telemetry on this site.** The Task Builder runs entirely in your browser; nothing leaves your machine.
- **Every product page is dated and sourced.** Specific model names, prices, and rate limits drift fast — see [Model freshness](model-freshness.md).
