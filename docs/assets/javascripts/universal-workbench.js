1. Restate the goal in one sentence.
2. Ask up to three questions only if you truly need more context.

- Use plain language.
- Use headings, bullets, or a table when that makes the result easier to use.
- Flag uncertainty instead of guessing.
- Tell me what I should review before I rely on the result.

After the answer:
- Give me one improved version of this prompt for next time.
- Suggest the best ${data.name} surface for repeating this workflow.`;
