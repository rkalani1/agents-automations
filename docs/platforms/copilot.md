## What this surface is

GitHub Copilot cloud agent (formerly Copilot coding agent) is an autonomous coding agent embedded in GitHub.com. You assign it a GitHub Issue or prompt it via Copilot Chat, and it works independently in a remote GitHub Actions-powered environment: it clones your repository, reads the codebase, creates an implementation plan, makes code changes on a branch, and pushes commits to a draft pull request. You then review the diff, request changes via pull request comments, and merge when satisfied.

This is distinct from Copilot in the IDE (VS Code, JetBrains, Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse). IDE Copilot provides inline completions and chat assistance in your local editor. The cloud agent works asynchronously in the background on GitHub, without any local editor involvement. According to the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent): "Copilot cloud agent works autonomously in a GitHub Actions-powered environment to complete development tasks assigned through GitHub issues or GitHub Copilot Chat prompts."

## Who it is best for

- Teams with a well-tested codebase who want to delegate low-to-medium complexity tasks from the backlog without assigning a developer.
- Individual developers who want to parallelize work: assign several small issues to Copilot while focusing on complex tasks themselves.
- Organizations that already use GitHub for issue tracking and pull requests and want minimal workflow disruption.

The [GitHub Blog announcement](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/) describes the agent as excelling at "low-to-medium complexity tasks in well-tested codebases": adding features, fixing bugs, extending tests, refactoring code, and improving documentation.

---

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository stored on GitHub.com (not repositories owned by managed user accounts, per the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent)).
- A compatible Copilot plan (see plan table below).
- For Business and Enterprise plans: an administrator must enable the Copilot cloud agent policy before it is available to repository contributors.
- The repository should have a reasonable test suite and clear coding conventions. The agent performs better with existing context to follow.

### Plan availability

| Plan | Access |
|---|---|
| GitHub Copilot Pro | Available |
| GitHub Copilot Pro+ | Available |
| GitHub Copilot Business | Available; administrator must enable the policy |
| GitHub Copilot Enterprise | Available; administrator must enable the policy |

Per the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent), repository owners can also opt individual repositories out of the cloud agent.

## How to assign an issue to Copilot

The workflow mirrors assigning any issue to a team member on GitHub.

### Method 1: Assign from the Issues page

1. Open the issue on GitHub.com.
2. In the right-hand **Assignees** panel, click the gear icon.
3. Search for or select **Copilot** from the assignee list.
4. Confirm. The agent adds a reaction (eyes emoji) to the issue to indicate it has picked up the task, per the [blog announcement](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/).

### Method 2: Prompt via Copilot Chat on GitHub

In Copilot Chat on GitHub.com, use the `@github` mention:

```
@github Open a pull request to fix the bug described in issue #42
```

Or to start a cloud task directly:

```
@github Refactor the query generator in src/db/query.py into its own class
```

### Method 3: Prompt via VS Code

From Copilot Chat in VS Code, ask Copilot to open a pull request. The agent spins up in the cloud and the work happens on GitHub, not in your local editor.

### What happens next

Once assigned, the agent:

1. Boots an ephemeral virtual machine (GitHub Actions runner).
2. Clones the repository.
3. Analyzes the codebase using advanced retrieval augmented generation (RAG) backed by GitHub code search, per the [blog post](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/).
4. Creates a draft pull request and pushes commits as it works.
5. Updates the pull request description with its plan and reasoning.
6. Logs reasoning and validation steps in the agent session logs (visible in the pull request timeline).
7. Tags you for review when done.

You can watch progress in the pull request's session logs in real time.

## How reviews work

Once the agent opens a draft pull request, review it as you would any other pull request:

1. Open the draft pull request on GitHub.
2. Review the diff. Check that the changes match the issue intent.
3. To request changes, add a comment in the pull request review, or mention `@copilot` in a PR comment to ask the agent to make specific adjustments. Per the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent): "Mention `@copilot` in a comment on an existing pull request to ask it to make changes."
4. The agent picks up your comment automatically and pushes additional commits.
5. When satisfied, mark the pull request ready for review and merge per your normal process.

### Security guardrails

The [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/) documents the following default policies:

- The agent can only push to branches it created. Your default branch and existing team branches are protected.
- The developer who assigned the task to Copilot cannot approve their own PR from Copilot (the standard "required reviews" rule still applies).
- The agent's internet access is limited to a trusted list of destinations, which can be customized.
- GitHub Actions workflows will not run on the agent's pull request without a human approving them first.
- Existing repository rulesets and organization policies apply to the agent the same as to any contributor.

These policies mean the agent cannot merge its own work or bypass your CI/CD gatekeeping.

## Worked example: rename a module and update imports

**Scenario:** You have a Python module called `src/helpers.py` that has been renamed in the codebase discussion to `src/utils.py`, but the rename has not been applied yet. Imports across the project still reference `helpers`. You want Copilot to handle the rename and import updates.

**Step 1 — Write a clear, scoped issue.**

Create a GitHub Issue with a description like:

```
Title: Rename helpers.py to utils.py and update all imports

Background: `src/helpers.py` should be renamed to `src/utils.py` following the
convention agreed in issue #38. All files that currently import from `helpers`
should be updated to import from `utils`. The public API of the module does not
change.

Acceptance criteria:
- `src/helpers.py` is renamed to `src/utils.py`
- All `from helpers import ...` and `import helpers` statements in the project
  are updated to reference `utils`
- Existing tests pass after the change
- No new functionality is added
```

**Step 2 — Assign to Copilot.**

In the Assignees panel on the issue page, select Copilot.

**Step 3 — Wait for the draft PR.**

The agent creates a draft pull request, typically within a few minutes for a small repository. The PR description will summarize the changes planned.

**Step 4 — Review the diff.**

Check that:

- The file has been renamed (not copied).
- All import references in other files have been updated.
- No imports have been missed.
- No unrelated files have been touched.

If you see a missed import or an unintended change, add a review comment:

```
@copilot You missed the import in src/cli/main.py on line 14. Please fix that.
```

The agent responds to the comment and pushes a new commit.

**Step 5 — Confirm tests pass.**

Review the GitHub Actions test run on the PR. If tests are failing, read the session logs to understand why the agent's changes may have caused them.

**Step 6 — Merge.**

When the diff is correct and tests pass, mark the PR ready and merge.

## Limits and gotchas

- **The agent performs best on low-to-medium complexity tasks.** Per the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent) and [blog post](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-meet-the-new-coding-agent/), highly complex architecture decisions, tasks with deep implicit context, or tasks requiring knowledge outside the repository are not well-suited for the agent.
- **Well-tested codebases produce better results.** The agent uses existing tests as validation signals. Sparse or absent tests reduce confidence in the output.
- **The agent cannot merge its own pull requests.** Human review and approval are always required.
- **GitHub Actions workflows do not run on the agent's PR without approval.** This is a security guardrail, but it means you need to manually trigger or approve CI if your workflow requires it.
- **Repository-level opt-out is available.** Owners can exclude specific repositories from the agent, per the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent).
- **Deep research and planning (research before opening a PR) are only available on GitHub.com.** External integrations (Azure Boards, Jira, Linear, Slack, Teams) only support creating a PR directly, per the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/agents/cloud-agent/about-cloud-agent).
- **The agent uses MCP servers configured in repository settings** to access data outside GitHub. If your task requires external context (e.g., a Jira ticket), you need to configure the appropriate MCP server.

## Cost and rate-limit notes

Copilot cloud agent consumes premium requests. GitHub's current billing docs say each cloud-agent session uses one premium request multiplied by the model's rate, and each real-time steering comment during an active session also uses one premium request multiplied by the model's rate. Complex tasks and frequent steering can therefore consume premium requests quickly. Check [GitHub Copilot requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests) and your usage dashboard before assigning many issues in parallel. For Business and Enterprise accounts, administrators can track adoption and pull request throughput using the Copilot usage metrics API.
