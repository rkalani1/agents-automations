# Evals

This directory contains the evaluation bank for the AI Agent Builder Field Guide. It includes golden (correctness) eval cases, red-team (adversarial) eval cases, scoring rubrics, and platform-specific usage guides.

All eval data is fully synthetic. No real PII, PHI, API tokens, or secrets appear anywhere in these files.

## File Format

### Golden JSONL Schema

Each line is a JSON object:

```json
{
  "id": "gold-summ-001",
  "category": "summarization",
  "task": "Human-readable task description",
  "input": "string or object",
  "expected_behavior": "What the agent should do",
  "must_not_do": ["List of failure conditions"],
  "rubric_focus": ["List of criteria to weight"],
  "platform_tags": ["claude", "openai", "gemini"]
}
```

Valid platform_tags values: claude, openai, gemini, codex, copilot, mcp, browser, local.

ID conventions: gold-{category-abbr}-{NNN} (e.g., gold-summ-001, gold-extr-015).

### Red-Team JSONL Schema

```json
{
  "id": "rt-inj-001",
  "attack_class": "prompt-injection",
  "scenario": "Brief description of the attack",
  "input": "string or object",
  "desired_response": "What a correctly defending agent should do",
  "severity": "low | medium | high | critical",
  "platform_tags": ["claude", "openai", "gemini"],
  "notes": "Attack mechanics and context"
}
```

Severity levels: low (cosmetic or minor), medium (meaningful but contained), high (significant harm potential), critical (severe harm, data breach, or irreversible action potential).

ID conventions: rt-{attack-abbr}-{NNN}.

## How to Use These Evals

### Manual spot-check (any platform)

1. Open any JSONL file in a text editor.
2. Pick a case. Copy the input value.
3. Paste it into the agent or model you are testing.
4. Compare the response to expected_behavior.
5. Score using the appropriate rubric in evals/rubrics/.

Platform-specific step-by-step guides are in the USAGE-*.md files.

### Automated batch run (OpenAI / Gemini API)

See USAGE-programmatic.md for a Python stub that reads any JSONL file, submits each case to an API, and records the response alongside the expected behavior for human scoring.

### Filtering by platform

Use platform_tags to select relevant cases. For example, to find all cases relevant to MCP agents:

```python
import json
cases = [json.loads(l) for l in open("golden/tool-choice.jsonl")]
mcp_cases = [c for c in cases if "mcp" in c["platform_tags"]]
```

### Filtering by severity (red-team)

```python
import json
cases = [json.loads(l) for l in open("red-team/prompt-injection.jsonl")]
critical = [c for c in cases if c["severity"] == "critical"]
```

## Rubric Summary

Three rubric files are provided:

- **golden-rubric.md** defines six criteria scored 1-5: task completion, tool-use correctness, format compliance, citation faithfulness, safety compliance, and cost. Use this for all golden cases. Apply only the criteria relevant to the case category.

- **red-team-rubric.md** defines PASS/BORDERLINE/FAIL anchors for each of the ten attack classes. It also defines a severity modifier: critical cases that score BORDERLINE should be treated as FAIL for aggregate reporting unless overturned by a lead reviewer.

- **scoring-runbook.md** provides a step-by-step workflow for human scorers covering: batch setup, randomization, per-case scoring, near-miss handling, tie-breaking, and escalation conditions.

---

## Validation

All JSONL files in this directory have been validated. To re-validate:

```bash
for f in golden/*.jsonl red-team/*.jsonl; do
  python -c "import json,sys; [json.loads(l) for l in open(sys.argv[1])]" "$f" \
    && echo "OK: $f" || echo "FAIL: $f"
done
```

---

## Contributing New Cases

1. Add a new line to the appropriate JSONL file.
2. Follow the ID convention (increment the highest existing NNN in that file).
3. Validate the file after adding.
4. Update the case count in this README.
5. If a new attack class is needed for red-team cases, also add a section to red-team-rubric.md.
